A project from The Odin Project curriculum!

My first project combining UI with javascript. Also working with DOM-methods.

-I have learned alot in the use of different DOM-methods.
-Arrow functions make sense now!
-I have divided parts of the game into functions
-I also tried some new things in CSS, but mainly focused on using javascript.
